# Midi Streaming

Electron JS application to stream midi data from a physical electronic drum set to a client application or web application via WebSockets. 

This project has mostly finished in terms of features (still needs graphics and a few basic features). My review 
is that the technology is really neat and has potential to be incorporated in other music applications and expanded with more MIDI
instruments. The roadblock that I have hit is with the audio playback. In my attempts, recreating the sound of the drums with 
the MIDI notes always left something to be desired.

                                UPDATE: This project has mostly finished (still needs graphics and a few basic
                                features). My review is that the technology is really neat and
                                has potential to be incorporated in other music applications and expanded with more MIDI
                                instruments. The roadblock that I have hit is with the audio playback. In my attempts,
                                recreating the sound of the drums with the MIDI notes always left something to be
                                desired.
